# WhoIsHome

A Andoid App writen in Kotlin to manage when who is not at home for dinner in your family.

I ended up doing this project, becasue I wanted to replace the daily WhatsApp conversation of who is at which time at home. And keep in mind, it's a side project from me and just for my personal fun.

- and you're ready to go!
