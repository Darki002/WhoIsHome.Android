# Set Up Firebase

## Collections

- person
- event

### person

```json
{
    "displayName": string,
    "email": string
}
```

the `id` can be autogenerated. I don't really care about it, becauce I use the email as a unique identifier.

### event

this one is currently way to complecated, because I store a whole DateTime class in it. Hope I can fix that in the futer.

If you have to create a first document, just use this:

```json
{
    "id": "set.up@setup.com - 123456789"
}
```
